Clients have the ability to **fully reinstall their NextCloud instance** directly from the client area. This feature is helpful in cases where a clean setup is needed due to misconfiguration or performance issues.

**Important:** Reinstalling the instance will result in **permanent data loss**. All files, user accounts, and settings stored within the container will be erased and replaced with a fresh NextCloud installation.

The reinstall process can be launched from the **Reinstall** page in the client interface. To avoid accidental reinstallation, the module includes a **confirmation prompt** to protect the user from unintended actions.
